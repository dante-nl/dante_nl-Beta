	<h1>Hi! I'm <span class="dante_nl">the mobile website</span></h1>
	<p>I am a teenage developer that enjoys coding A LOT! I would rather code one day than I would to do my favorite
		subject at
		school for a day (history). Ik ben geboren in Nederland, maar ik spreek Engels beter dan Nederlands (I am
		born in the
		Netherlands, but I speak English better than Dutch). I prefer the U.S. version of English, but sadly, the
		U.K. version
		is taught at my school, so sometimes it’s a bit difficult to understand, but most of the time it’s pretty
		easy to
		understand. I also learn French at school, but it’s not as simple as English sadly. I would rate it 1/10, I
		wouldn’t
		start it, but it can be nice tho if you are going to France, and it’s somewhat close to the Netherlands
		(theoretically
		we share a border on the island of Sint Maarten / Saint Martin, which is nowhere near the Netherlands), the
		only
		obstacle is Belgium, but there they also speak French. Anyways, I moved to #off-topic…</p>
	<br>
	<p>I really like Discord, so much that my default profile picture is Wumpus, one of Discord’s mascots. Because
		of that, the
		accent color on this website is blurple (#7289da). You can join my Discord via my sidebar on the right on
		your screen or if you're on mobile, below my biography.</p>
